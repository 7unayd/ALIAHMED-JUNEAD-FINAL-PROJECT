This is final project of Aliahmed Junead for Goldsmiths university of London
there are 2 files:
an iypnb file and a HTML file.

the iypnb will not work on its own, however the HTML file will enable to view the project without making changes.
to run the project, go to this link, and there will be two zip files: one for the CNN model the other for the MLP model.
down load them and then run the notebooks
